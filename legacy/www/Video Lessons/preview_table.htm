<p><a name="bowing1"></a><span >BOWING 1</span>
In this lesson you will learn how to start bowing with the correct bowgrip, and how to get rid of squeaks and scratches in your sound. </p>
<p><a name="bowing2"></a><span >BOWING 2</span>
Learn some basic rhythms, and see how dividing the bow up in half can help you keep a steady beat.</p>
<p><a name="bowing3"></a> <span >BOWING 3</span>
This is a call and response video, where I will play some rhythms learned in BOWING 2, and you will play them back.
We will also work on smooth string crossings.</p>
