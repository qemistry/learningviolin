<p><strong><span >Video Lessons </span></strong></p>
<p>Welcome to my video lessons! Here you can buy access to 5-10 minute violin lessons, using paypal and your credit card. </p>
<p>I have written and produced these video lessons in response to the hundreds of e-mails I have received in the past few years, from those of you who don't have a violin teacher in your area. The most common e-mail questions I get are about tuning the violin, and I have posted the Tuning video, along with the Posture and Bowgrip videos for you to view for free. There are lots of video lessons in the works, from playing by ear to reading music, rhythms, theory, and I will go in detail into every technincal aspect of playing the violin. I hope everyone will find an episode of a subject they want to learn more about, but I also welcome all suggestions for new episodes. </p>
<p>Simply browse through the episodes, read the brief description about each one, and when you are ready you can click on the link which will bring you to the payment page. Once your payment has been confirmed you will receive an e-mail within 24 hours with the link and a password that gives you access to the video you chose.</p>
<p>Please contact me directly at <a href="mailto:ima@learningviolin.com">ima@learningviolin.com</a> if you have any problems using this service.</p>
