Thoroughly enjoyed your site, retired guitarist, country entertainer, just picked up a fiddle for the first time last week, and your site has been the
most helpful regarding the usage of the bow. Just playing for my own enjoyment. Have a few friends locally here in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada
that are accomplished violinists but they are too busy to bother about lessons just now. I'm still active in the AF of M locally, and in the music
business as a Booking Agent/Talent Manager, Counry Music. Located your site from one of your students home page. Thanks for all the helpful
information.
hi..
this site is pretty good
aravind
love'd yer web site.
Hi
You won't believe what a great help your site is. I am 21 yr old med. student with no time whatsoever. Hence, I cannot possibly go to a tutor. Your site gives me the opportunity to still try to learn to play the violin. Thank you so much.
Thanks Ima,
I'm a 31 year old husband and father of three that has picked up the fiddle about 7 months ago.
I had to relocate and no longer have a professional fiddle instructor.
Your site has helped me a lot with some basics.
I would really appreciate any fiddle-specific tips you can give me on producing clear tone when playing doublestops.
Thanks
Hi Ima
A really great site. Wish I lived near you and I'd come for lessons. Live in U.K.I'm not as young as some of the kiddywinks in your group pic., but I'm working hard to master the fiddle. Good Luck.
Hi Ima,
Wow, this is a terrific site.
I can't wait to come and see a show.
I didn't know you were so famous. :)
I'll see you Wed.
Dearest Ima
Just wanted to congradulate you for the wonderful site. I'm adding a link from my site to yours on my next site update. Looks Super and I'm happy to hear that this site is so effective - it's not suprising. All the best. Love. Rani http://www.eyran.com

Thank you very much for this beautiful site.
I will look for your CD.
Can you please tell me where I might find the poster you have of the lady sitting at the table with her violin in her hand.
It makes me feel inspired, nostalgic, and all good things!
Thanks again.

I love the e-lessons! I visited this site long ago when the e-lessons were still under construction. I'm so glad to see what it is now.
It would be great if you can put more exercises for the third position.
What a fun and informative site! (The designer must be very talented.) I was never much of a violinist as a child, but I have since
have retrieved my violin from my parents.
Q: "How do you get to Carnegie Hall?"
A: "Practice!"
best, Richard
THIS IS VERY INTERESTING PAGE.I HAVE JUST STARTED TO PLAY THE FIDDLE AND I
HOPE YOUR E LESSONS ARE AVAILABLE SOON.IWOULD LIKE TO LEARN TO READ MUSIC.
GOOD LUCK AND THANK YOU.
You've done a great job on your site!! I've always wanted to take up the piano since I was young. Now that I'm older and have thought more about it I think that I would find learning the fiddle way more gratifying. I'm just dibbling into the information highway on taking up this instrument. Your site was a fabulous help. Thank you very much!
Jennifer :O)

Ég er alveg rosalega stolt af þér, þú ert algjör hetja.

Ólöf: Che bello!! Íma þetta er mjög skemmtileg síða og við pabbi erum búin að fara í alla leikina. Unnum hengingarleikinn, deildum um hvort hluti bogans sem maður heldur
á heiti END eða FROG og þar sem pabbi vildi endilega kalla hlutann END fengum við vitlaust svar þar, mamma reddaði líka nokkrum svörum. Nú svo rugluðum við 2 dömum í Whose head is it. Mjög skemmtilegir leikir. Eina sem er eftir er að bóka þig til að spila einhversstaðar!! ÆÐISLEG SÍÐA.
Jón: Íma þú ert frábær!
