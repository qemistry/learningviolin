No.
The actual instrument is the same.
If you are just starting out, I recommend renting an instrument for at least a few months first.
Once you've decided you want to continue, ask your teacher to help you buy a violin.
There is no brand of violin that is better than another, since the sound of every violin is individual.
It is difficult for a beginner to tell whether the violin is functioning properly.
If you are in the Boston area, I am available to help you choose an instrument.
If you take lessons with me, I can help you for free.
Otherwise,<a href=mailto:ima@learningviolin.com> e-mail me </a>for more information on setting up an appointment with me.
A beginner can start with 15 - 30 minutes a day, depending on their age.
You can then add a half hour to your practice time with each new year that you study.
It's never too late!
You can learn violin at almost any age.
For very young children, I recommend the Suzuki method of violin.
I can teach children over 5 years old.
There are some very accomplished violin and fiddle players who are self-taught.
However, you will probably learn quicker and be able to do more if you have an instructor who teaches you the proper technique.

Scrape the rosin with a coin before applying to the full length of the bow.
If the bow is brand new, then swipe the rosin on the bow about 50 (yes, 50) times.
Well, it depends on how often you play.
If you play every day, then apply rosin once a week or so.
Scrape the rosin with a coin before applying to the full length of the bow.
