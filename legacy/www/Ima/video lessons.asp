Learn
the basics from my video lesson.
Are you interested in taking private lessons, but there
are no teachers in your area?&nbsp; Well, this might be
a small solution.&nbsp; You can now download this 10
minute video lesson, and learn the basics.&nbsp; These
are the things I teach my students at their first
lesson:
<li>Posture - How to hold the violin.</li>
<li>Reading - How to read the open strings.</li>
<li>Pizzicato - Start making music by plucking the
strings.</li>
<li>Bowgrip - How to hold the bow.&nbsp; </li>
<li>and more...</li>
</ul>

This video clip
is just the start of my newest project, which is a
production of violin lessons on videos.&nbsp; Each video
lesson will be 30 minutes in length, and will eventually
be on sale through my website.&nbsp; So you can soon
have your own private teacher at home.&nbsp;
The first videos will be for the very beginner.&nbsp;
You will learn how to play with a beautiful sound, (no
squeaky sounds!), how to read notes in first position
and use all your fingers on all the strings in first
position, how to recognize intervals which will help you
play by ear, and oh...so much more.&nbsp; You will be on
your way to playing all your favorite tunes, whether you
learn them by reading music or learn them by ear.&nbsp;
Hopefully you will be able to do both!
