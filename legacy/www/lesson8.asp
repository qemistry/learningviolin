Each finger on the left hand (except the thumb) has a corresponding
number.
The number tells you what finger to use for which note.
0 = Open string (no finger)
1 = Index finger
2 = Middle finger
3 = Ring finger
4 = Pinky finger

This diagram represents where you put your fingers to make
each note.
For third position, you shift your entire left
hand (thumb and all) up the fingerboard until your first finger is at the
place where your third finger would be in first position.
That's why it is called "third position"!
A whole step / half step simply refers to the distance
between two notes.
A half step is half the distance of
a whole step (how easy is that?)
If you are playing a full size violin, a whole step is
approximately an inch.
For a half step, the fingers are
right next to each other touching.
(This is all approximate
because it depends on the size of your fingers.)

Here are some notes and corresponding fingerings for third position.
