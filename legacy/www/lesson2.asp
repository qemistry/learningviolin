Here are the notes corresponding to the open strings of the violin:
<p><img SRC="openstring.GIF">
The lines of the staff (from bottom to top) are E G B D F (Every Good
Boy Deserves Fudge).
The spaces of the staff are F A C E (or face).
The above notes are whole notes.
That means they last 4 beats
(count 1, 2, 3, 4).
A half note lasts for 2 beats.
A quarter
note lasts one beat.
Don't be confused with the names and the number
of beats the note gets.
It is a quarter of a whole note, not a quarter
of a beat.

A quarter note can be split into smaller counts:

To make many notes easy to read, they are linked together:

Rests have counts too.
Rests are times when you don't play any
notes:

Adding a dot to a notes adds one-half to its original duration.
Remember a duration is how many beats the note is played.

Counting each beat can help you figure out when to play the notes written
on the music.
Each beat is a number - beat 1, beat 2, beat 3, beat
4.
When you tap your foot, each time your foot hits the floor is
a beat 1, 2, 3, 4.
Each time your foot is in the air, say "and".
1 and 2 and 3 and
4.
Each "and" is a half beat.
But there's even more!
In between the beat and the half beat,
there is a half of a half beat (or sixteenth note).
Say "1 e and
a" then "2 e and a".
See example below.
The underlined words
are when you play the note.

One more thing.
A sharp raises a note a half step.
A flat
lowers a note a half step.
