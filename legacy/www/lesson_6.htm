(where you put your fingers)
A whole step / half step simply refers to the distance between two notes. A half step is half the distance of a whole step (how easy is that?)
If you are playing a full size violin, a whole step is approximately an inch. For a half step, the fingers are right next to each other touching. (This is all approximate because it depends on the size of your fingers.)
Here are some notes and corresponding fingerings for first position.
