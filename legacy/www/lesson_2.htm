The above notes are whole notes. That means they last 4 beats (count 1, 2, 3, 4). A half note lasts for 2 beats. A quarter note lasts one beat. Don't be confused with the names and the number of beats the note gets. It is a quarter of a whole note, not a quarter of a beat.

But there's even more! In between the beat and the half beat, there is a half of a half beat (or sixteenth note). Say "1 e and a" then "2 e and a". See example below. The underlined words are when you play the note.
