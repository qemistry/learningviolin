Delivering Premium SophistiFunk Experience:
The vocals-soulful, with thoughtful, insightful lyrics. The guitars-funk and wail the blues. The keyboards-lush and full of quirky grooves. The bass lines-heads nod & eyebrows curl. The drums-dance as you are astounded by the virtuosity. In the tradition of Frank Zappa, Stevie Wonder, The Police and Steely Dan lies the next great band that takes groove composition and intelligent lyrics to the next level.
The Reviews:
Of their recent Boston's City Hall Plaza concert Phil McKenna of ProgressiveEars.com says, "I found myself in a wondrous zone presided over by...keyboardist/composer/vocalist/guitarist David Zoffer and his band Differential, performing live for an.... amazed... audience... funky, syncopated drumming, deep thoughtful bass and tasty, understated analog keyboards." He goes on to say of Zoffer's debut double CD, The Beginning of the End, vols. 1 & 2, "David gets down and dirty on guitar to grand effect here... great interweaving vocals... throughout, everyone turns in stellar performances with great wit."
The Venues:
David Zoffer and his band the David Zoffer Differential have played everywhere in Boston from City Hall Plaza to rock clubs like Johnny D's, Paradise, Bill's Bar, The Middle East and distinguished jazz venues such as the Regattabar, Sculler's, Jordan Hall, and The Center for the Arts in Natick.
The Accolades:
Zoffer's compositional brilliance, tight arrangements and soloing genius won him the Boston Jazz Society Grant putting him in distinguished company with past winners like Branford Marsalis. He was selected two years in a row as a Mellon Jazz Festival All-Star. World music giant Bob Moses has called him, "a genius." Paul Bley has said of Zoffer's compositions and vocals, "He's doing about six things I've never heard before, all at the same time." Guggenheim recipient Wendell Logan has said of Zoffer's music, "What we have here is a new vernacular." Hankus Netsky of the Klezmer Conservatory Band raves, "What's good about (Zoffer's pieces) is that they're both new and accessible.
The History:
Zoffer's career began in Pittsburgh with roots in Classic Rock, Classic Jazz, and Funk/Hip-Hop and it has taken him to play in New York, his present home base in Boston, and as far away as Reykjavik, Iceland and London. Along the way he has played with Jazz and Pop luminaries ranging from Bela Fleck, Harry Connick, Jr. , Eddie Gomez, Bob Moses, and Don Byron, and he is currently chairman of the Prep/Cont. Ed. Jazz Dept. at the New England Conservatory.
The Band Instrumentation:
Rajdulari-lead vocal/keys
David Zoffer-keys/guitar/vocal
Jamie Stewardson-bass/guitar
Eric Doob-drums
On , the listener is welcomed by the thunderous sounds of the clavinet, a violin invoking Indian classical music over tight syncopation and ferocious "in the pocket" drumming. The EP features Ima Jonsdottir on violin, Jamie Stewardson on electric bass, Darren Siman on drums and David Zoffer on keyboards and vocals. The buzz over the DZD is growing louder throughout their native Boston. This group's trailblazing sophistifunk moves, grooves, and confuses its delightfully surprised audiences who can not figure out why they are dancing.
